2. Unzip it, paste both `KindleForge/` and `KindleForge.sh` into the `documents/` folder on your Kindle.
3. Run the scriptlet, and have fun!

## Features

## Minimum Requirements

- AdBreak, WinterBreak, or LanguageBreak
- Latest Universal Hotfix
- Above the 5.6.1.1 firmware in the least
- Both **hard-float and soft-float** kindles should work, but not all packages may support both architectures.

## Troubleshooting

Try reloading multiple times, rebooting, or re-copying assets from the latest release and trying again.
